# Note that rsync handles `/mnt/storage` and `/mnt/storage/` differently.

# Source directory path for backup (without trailing slash to copy directory itself)
SOURCE="/mnt/storageA"

# Destination directory path where backup will be stored
DESTINATION="/mnt/storageB"

# Rsync command options:
# -a: archive mode (preserves permissions, timestamps, symbolic links, etc.)
# -A: preserve ACLs (Access Control Lists)
# -X: preserve extended attributes
# -H: preserve hard links
# -q: quiet mode (suppress non-error messages)
# --delete: delete extraneous files from destination
# --one-file-system: don't cross filesystem boundaries
# --exclude=.snapshots: exclude snapshot directories from backup
RSYNC_OPTIONS="-aAXHq --delete --one-file-system --exclude=.snapshots"

# Maximum wait time in seconds for acquiring the file lock
# If another backup process is running, wait up to this duration before giving up
